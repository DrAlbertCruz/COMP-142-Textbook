<p>Computers use binary numbers because they are made up of electronic components that have only two states, on and off. Each unit is referred to as a bit. We refer to this system as binary because a single unit's state can only have one of two values. You may sometimes see the states referred to as asserted or deasserted in a computer engineering context, or True of False in a mathematical context. In this course we use 0 and 1 to represent the states of a bit. A sequence of bits is treated as a number. Binary numbers use a base 2 number system, which means that each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. By convention, the right-most side refers to the least-significant power of two, or

        <msup>
            <mi>2</mi>
            <mn>0</mn>
        </msup>
    </math> 

For example, the binary number <code>1010</code> corresponds to the value 10 in the decimal system. It is equal to <math>(1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10.</math></p>

Binary numbers are used in computing because they are well-suited to electronic circuits. It is relatively easy to build circuits that can distinguish between the two states of on and off, and to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction using binary numbers.

In addition, binary numbers are also used to represent data and instructions in computer memory and in computer programs. For example, the ASCII code used to represent characters in computer systems uses binary numbers, with each character represented by a unique sequence of 8 binary digits (or bits).

Overall, binary numbers provide a simple and efficient way for computers to represent and manipulate data, and to perform the complex calculations required in modern computing.
