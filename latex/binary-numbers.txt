A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). In more mathematical or logical contexts 0 is treated as False and 1 is treated as True.

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a base of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical implementation.[1]
